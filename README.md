# Criterion A: Planning
## Problem Definition
My client, Mrs. X, is an ESS teacher at an International Baccalaureate (IB) school. She aims to enhance the engagement of her classes by incorporating hands-on, experiential learning activities that connect students with the local environment. Specifically, she wants to take her students to a nearby forest to conduct transect sampling, a method used to study species distribution and biodiversity **(Refer to Appendix A - Email Correspondence with Mrs. X)**. To support this activity, Mrs. X envisions a website where students can upload images of species observed in the forest, with the system automatically extracting location data from the images’ metadata and plotting these locations on some maps interface. The website would also allow users to view the distribution of various species in the forest, along with attached images, and provide tools for quadrant transect sampling analysis, including distribution graphs, kite diagrams, and statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum **(Refer to Appendix A - Email Correspondence with Mrs. X)**.

Currently, Mrs. X relies on traditional classroom methods, such as lectures and textbook-based learning, to teach ecological concepts. However, these methods lack the interactive and practical components needed to fully engage students and help them connect theoretical knowledge with real-world applications. There is no existing system in place at the school to facilitate field-based activities like transect sampling in a structured, technology-supported manner. This makes it challenging to organize, document, and analyze data collected during field trips, limiting the educational impact of such activities **(Refer to Appendix A - Email Correspondence with Mrs. X)**.

The absence of a dedicated platform to support this initiative creates inefficiencies, as manual data collection and analysis are time-consuming and prone to errors. Additionally, without a centralized system to visualize species locations and perform statistical analysis, students miss out on opportunities to develop data analysis skills and gain a deeper understanding of ecological patterns. Therefore, Mrs. X seeks a web-based solution to streamline the process of collecting, visualizing, and analyzing species data during forest transect sampling, making classes more engaging and fostering a stronger connection between students and their local environment **(Refer to Appendix A - Email Correspondence with Mrs. X)**

## Proposed Solution
To address Mrs. X’s need for a more engaging classroom experience through field-based transect sampling in a local forest, I propose developing a web-based application using Flask, a Python-based micro-framework, to create a platform where students can upload images of species, extract location data from image metadata, visualize species locations on a Google Maps interface, and perform quadrant transect sampling analysis **(Refer to Appendix A - Email Correspondence with Mrs. X)**. The system will include a secure login using a SQL database to ensure only registered users, such as students and teachers, can upload images, with special administrative access for Mrs. X to monitor and delete images as needed. The application will leverage Python with Matplotlib for generating distribution graphs and kite diagrams, and CSS with limited JavaScript for a visually appealing and user-friendly interface **(Refer to Appendix B - Transcript of System Requirements Discussion with Mrs. X)**.

Initially, I considered using Django for the web framework due to its robust built-in features, such as an admin panel and authentication system, which could simplify user management **(Refer to Appendix B - Transcript of System Requirements Discussion with Mrs. X)**. However, Django’s complexity and heavier structure could increase development time for a relatively straightforward application. Flask, being lightweight and flexible, is better suited for this project, as it allows for rapid development and easy integration with external APIs like Google Maps, while still supporting a secure SQL-based authentication system. Flask’s minimalistic approach also aligns with the project’s scope, which prioritizes simplicity and functionality for classroom use **(Refer to Appendix B - Transcript of System Requirements Discussion with Mrs. X)**.

The application will use SQLite for its simplicity and compatibility with Flask to store user credentials, image metadata, and transect sampling data. SQLite is lightweight and does not require a separate server, making it ideal for a school-based application. The login system will ensure that only registered students and Mrs. X can access the platform, with password hashing for security. Mrs. X will have an admin account with elevated privileges, allowing her to view all uploaded images and delete any that are irrelevant or inappropriate **(Refer to Appendix A - Email Correspondence with Mrs. X)**.

The Google Maps API will be integrated to display species locations extracted from image EXIF metadata. This will allow students to visualize where specific species are found in the forest. The transect sampling feature will use Python with Matplotlib to generate distribution graphs and kite diagrams, providing statistical insights such as mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum values for species counts within quadrants.

The front-end will be styled using CSS with minimal JavaScript to handle dynamic elements like form submissions and map interactions. This ensures the website is clean, intuitive, and functional without introducing unnecessary complexity.

This proposed solution addresses Mrs. X’s goal of making classes more engaging by providing a platform that supports hands-on learning, streamlines data collection and analysis, and ensures security through a controlled user environment. The use of Flask, SQLite, Google Maps API, and Matplotlib provides a robust yet manageable system tailored to the educational context, enabling students to connect theoretical ESS with practical field experience

## Success Criteria
1. Secure Login: Use SQLite with bcrypt hashing for secure user login, allowing only registered students and Mrs. X to access the platform.
2. Admin Panel: Mrs. X’s admin panel enables viewing and deleting inappropriate images to maintain a safe educational environment.
3. User Registration: Students register via a form, storing username, email, and hashed password in SQLite.
4. Image Upload: Registered users upload species images; the system extracts GPS coordinates from EXIF metadata.
5. Google Maps: Display species locations on Google Maps with markers showing GPS coordinates from images.
6. Transect Analysis: Support quadrant transect sampling with Matplotlib-generated graphs, kite diagrams, and stats (mean, standard deviation, max, min).
7. Data Validation: Validate image metadata for GPS data and ensure transect data is numeric and valid.
8. User Interface: Provide a CSS-styled, user-friendly interface with minimal JavaScript for form and map interactions.
9. Admin Reports: Mrs. X can download image and transect data reports in CSV format for classroom use.
10. Performance: Pages and visualizations load within 5 seconds under normal network conditions.
11. Data Persistence: Store user data, image metadata, and transect results in SQLite to prevent data loss.
12. Accessibility: Ensure compatibility with Chrome and Firefox on school or personal devices without extra software.
has to start from the verd. It allows ........ most of them are not valid
